# People Not Statistics

There are a lot of trackers for COVID-19 recently showing very large numbers ticking upwards everyday. But it's hard to internalize such huge numbers. This app shows the number of people in the US who have died in the past day due to COVID-19 as a graphic of people, rather than a simple integer. I believe it gives a new perspective on the number of Americans who have lost their life to this virus - one that is less numbed by pure statistics.

## Installation

First run `npm install` to install dependencies. Then run `npm start` to run the app.
